Experiments in distributed queueing

![It Goes To 11!](http://beerpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/BellsGoesTo11Front.png?raw=true)

Anon is an experiment in server design for "Services".  It attempts to achieve
several goals.  These are:

* Maximize efficiency on a single CPU instance
* Effeciently deal with "over-maximum" requests
* Provide a reasonable dev environment

Anon is currenty HIGHLY experimental and is unlike other service designs in many
ways.  For example, it is currently all written in C++.  The name "anon" comes
from the first two goals, and is the word "anon", meaning something like "again",
not an abreviation for "anonymous".
